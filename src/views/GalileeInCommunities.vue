        Hosting Galilee in your community isn't just setting up prayer partners. Galilee addresses 
        indispensable elements of any discipleship strategy: the primacy of prayer and the practice of witness 
        in the life of the disciple.

      <h3 class="pt-5">
        As communities are enriched by individuals deep in prayer, they build a culture 
        that can sustain mission.

            Galilee creates a beautiful point of contact and connection for those new to your community— or to Christianity. It invites them to engage in a way that serves their spiritual growth—and that of the community.

        "Galilee brought incredible new life to our parish's marriage preparation program. 
        Couples who were already married prayed together and deepened their marriages. Engaged couples felt like 
        they were being welcomed into a community, instead of just having a bunch of material 
        impersonally thrown at them. Couples that I thought would have no interest in belonging to 
        our church have experienced incredible growth.”
