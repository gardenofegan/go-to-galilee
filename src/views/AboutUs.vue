        Galilee began in a coffee shop in an historic neighborhood, in 2019. It was just a couple of friends trying to 
        encourage one another in their faith. Different from the discipleship, accountability, and other programs they 
        had experienced, they discovered a natural way to walk and grow together. But they had no idea how many 
        others were looking for something just like this. By summer of 2020, dozens of young adults were all 
        encouraging one another by their witness through Galilee
      </p>
      <p>
        We weren't trying to start a ministry, yet that was exactly what God would ask of Jacob in August. <em>"I want to 
        transform cities with this. Make this your full-time job."</em> So the nonprofit, Go To Galilee, was formed in September. 
        The company is still young and inexperienced, but it is answering God's call, and people keep responding.  <strong><em>This is 
        our time. A generation is hungry for the grace God is offering through Galilee.</em></strong>

      <p class="pb-5">
        Today, Galilee is used among youth, young adults, marriage prep couples, new believer programs, independent 
        small groups… the list goes on. And everywhere it goes, it works the same way: deepening relationship with 
        Christ, the Source of all fruitfulness in ministry, and increasing dependence on the Holy Spirit, the Source of all 
        unity.

      <h5>The Church is called to mission, and each disciple with Her.</h5>
      <p>
        From his early years, Jacob wanted nothing more than to be on the front-lines of a Church-on-mission. His 
        expectations for a life of Church ministry took a turn as he started a family and pursued a career path in the 
        corporate world. But something wasn't satisfied. 
      </p>
      <h5>Our thirst is as great as the Living Water that satisfies it. Until the disciple drinks without 
        ceasing, a mission is an opportunity to die of thirst.</h5>
      <p>
        He pursued every opportunity to teach, lead, and participate in the Church that he could find.  Some endeavors lasted a month—others a year. Time seemed to wear down his zeal for particular ministries. Then the Holy 
        Spirit gave him a nudge and he came to a realization: “I don't think I know how to pray.”  He had no idea how 
        essential prayer would be to his mission.
      </p>
      <h5>
        When serving our mission is consistently the overflow of our relationship with God, all 
        things are possible. 
      </h5>
      <p>
        Where could he continue growing in the transforming grace of the Gospel, help others, and have a lasting 
        impact on the Church? Eight years after his “nudge,” Galilee took shape and the Holy Spirit revealed His calling 
        for the transformation of cities. So Jacob opened a company, sought mission partners to fund the mission, and 
        began to learn how Galilee impacted the life of the disciple. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Go To Galilee works to promote the three-fold mission renewing and deepening personal prayer, establishing a culture that can sustain the Church's mission, and helping to build visible signs of Christian Unity. 
        Meanwhile, Jacob continues to serve, to grow, and to thirst.
