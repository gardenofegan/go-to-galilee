        Inviting someone into a Galilee is inviting them into an exercise routine—a journey—with you.
        Each meeting is a chance to practice natural and supernatural skills essential to our interior walk of 
        prayer: our relationship with Jesus Christ.

        This may seem like a subtle and simple practice, however, over the past year, 
        following the Galilee model has <strong>greatly impacted my ability to be attentive to the 
        Lord</strong>. My heart has been moved in prayer and witnessing how He is speaking to 
        others has deepened many areas of my own life. From greater discussion on prayer 
        to having richer conversations with others, <strong>the simple tool of Galilee has been one 
        of the most effective means of reflecting on what Jesus is asking of me to best 
        follow Him</strong>.
