        Inviting someone into a Galilee is inviting them into an exercise routine—a journey—with you.
        Each meeting is a chance to practice natural and supernatural skills essential to our interior walk of 
        prayer: our relationship with Jesus Christ.

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            God is always working and speaking in our lives. Reflecting on what God is doing in you continues building familiarity with His presence and voice.

          <h4>Prayer</h4>
          <p>
            The Christian encounters Scripture as the Word of God, Himself. We practice and grow in relationship through this encounter.

        This may seem like a subtle and simple practice, however, over the past year, 
        following the Galilee model has <strong>greatly impacted my ability to be attentive to the 
        Lord</strong>. My heart has been moved in prayer and witnessing how He is speaking to 
        others has deepened many areas of my own life. From greater discussion on prayer 
        to having richer conversations with others, <strong>the simple tool of Galilee has been one 
        of the most effective means of reflecting on what Jesus is asking of me to best 
        follow Him</strong>.
